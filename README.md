THE PROBLEM:
A huge earthquake hit Turkey and Syria in 2023. Buildings fell, thousands got trapped under rubble, and many died. It nearly killed 59,000 people in the time, 
where nobody could afford any help. People were crying for help on social media, but it was hard to know who needed help most and where. It was really difficult to sort the datas 
among the positive, negative & help needed data, neutral comments & posts/tweets etc.

OUTCOME: 
1) No faster rescues
2) Authorities were unable to plan, no enough equipments
3) Large amount of death rate

MY SOLUTION:
This project analyses the data from various social media sites and draw the results based on positive, negative, neutral sections of posts that were posted duing the crisis 
happened. This creates a use of Word cloud that helps to filter the words that require help and the visualizations on 
● the location where the posts are maximum posted, 
● data on how much posts that contains help needed ones, 
● a pie chart for better understanding. 

OUTCOME:
1) Help authorities to plan well & rescue people who got trapped
2) Tends to faster rescues, reduce death rates

MY FUTURE IDEA:
I wish to create an alert system for the authorities who get notified immediately the moment a post that has help/rescue/trapped to make faster & efficient action :)
